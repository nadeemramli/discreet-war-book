## Description:
This is a website I use as sandbox for my technical marketing project. This is where I practice my HTML, CSS and JS. Also, my measurement marketing skills. I tried to play around with the GTM, GA4, and some other measurement. 


## Why?:
Hey there! This is Nadeem. If you happen to read this, I just wanted to take a chance to say thank you. This is my personal project, where I host my writing called Discreet War. The writing itself is self-explanatory, you can read it [here.](https://nadeemramli) This project was meant to be a sandbox for me to practice HTML/CSS and JS while creatively include meaningful context.

## Project Log:
1/12/2023: Restarted the web, this time I started with boot.dev. Let's see if we can implement some basic JS.
